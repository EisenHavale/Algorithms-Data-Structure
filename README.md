# Practice data structure with Javascript and Java

This repository is created to work on data structure and document as many comments as possible.
**why?** because I'm sure that interview challenges and algorithm excercises are quite accessible if the developer has a well documented knowledge in data structure.

Additionally it's important to remember that efficiency is a pretty important factor. It can be improved or easily be calculated based on the type of data structure used

**Most commom data structures are:** 

* Arrays
* Maps
* Objects
* Queues
* Enums
* Hash
* List
* Linked
* StringBuilder

## Solutions

To submit a solution and merge those changes into main needs:

1. Problem description at the top of the file in a multi line comment defining allow activities
2. Solution explanation at the very end of the code, only looked for in case the code It's not that easy to understand.
3. Two solutions one per each programming language 
4. A Method can't have more than 3 arguments or boolean arguments.
5. Names of the functions must be verbs not nouns 
6. First Solid principle must be applied that way solutions must be cohesive and low coupling
7. Each solution should provide some testing values and the logic behind those values that way It can be easily tested by anyone
8. Code must pass at least 7 tests
9. A calification based on Big O notation

A wanted addition is to create a Use interface to deploy and allow anyone to test this solutions

### Important

Before start coding take a moment to properly think in the problem, identify the inputs ouputs and as many details as possible that way you think twice and code once.
